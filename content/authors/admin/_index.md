## About Me

Hi, I'm Adam. I'm a PhD student in the CDT in Topological Design at the University of Birmingham. I primarily work on simulating self-assembly in colloidal systems and then probing the properties of the ordered structures formed. I decided to make this website as a learning tool to share my interests and keep notes for my projects.
